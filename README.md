# ioBroker.kiwi

**Beta version. need more testing!**

## Connecting

The following settings work in modern MCP clients like VSCode or Claude Desktop etc.

```json
{
	"servers": {
		"iobroker-remote": {
			"type": "http",
			"url": "http://192.168.178.38:8082/kiwi/0/mcp",
			"headers": { "cache-control": "no-cache" }
		}
	}
}
```

for older clients that only support sse and stdio you can use mcp-remote

```json
{
	"servers": {
		"iobroker-remote": {
			"type": "stdio",
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "http://<your-iobroker-ip>:<web-adapter-port>/kiwi/0/mcp", "--allow-http"]
		}
	}
}
```

## ioBroker

you can use it from inside iobroker with two states:

- kiwi.0.chat.prompt
- kiwi.0.chat.response

or in javascript adpater

```
function getAiResponse(txt){
    return new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
        once("kiwi.0.chat.response",data=>{
            resolve(data.state.val)
        })
        setState("kiwi.0.chat.prompt",txt)
    })
}
```

and then

```
console.log(await getAIResponse("helllo"))
```

## Basic Usage

you add descriptions to states with custom configs.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a2c5aab-afb1-49a8-866c-323f01a23e28)

the description will be turned into vector embeddings and stored in a vector database.

you can then say: "switch the test state to false" or "set test to false" or something along these lines. This is language-agnostic because it will match the semantic meaning. So you can describe the state in any language and `search` in another language.

you can tell the bot to describe states for you while talking with it about your system. It will use the `describe` MCP tool to enable the custom setting and set a description.

there are other tools the bot can use like setState, getState, setObject, getObject, getHistory, etc.

## MCP Tools

- **search.mjs** – Semantic search for state objects (vector search).
- **describe.mjs** – Set a description for a single object (enables semantic search).
- **describeBulk.mjs** – Set descriptions for multiple objects at once.
- **deleteItemFromIndex.mjs** – Remove an item from the semantic search index.
- ~~**createScene.mjs** – Create a new ioBroker scene (group of state/value pairs).~~
- **mingoSearch** - a search tool for objects in the object database. uses MongoDB style queries.

### low level functions

- **getObject.mjs** – Get a single ioBroker object by ID.
- **setObject.mjs** – Edit or create objects in ioBroker.
- **deleteObject.mjs** – Delete any ioBroker object (device, channel, state, or folder).
- **getState.mjs** – Get the value of a state by ID.
- **getStateBulk.mjs** – Get values of multiple states at once.
- **setState.mjs** – Set the value of a state.
- **setStateBulk.mjs** – Set multiple state values at once.
- ~~**createState.mjs** – Create a new ioBroker state object.~~
- **getAllRooms.mjs** – List all valid rooms and areas.
- **getHistory.mjs** – Retrieve historical state data (time series, trends).
- **getAdapters.mjs** – List all installed adapters in the system.
- ~~**getInstances.mjs** – List all running adapter instances.~~

### file handling

- **readDir.mjs** – Read the contents of a directory in the ioBroker file system.
- **readFile.mjs** – Read the contents of a file in the ioBroker file system.
- **writeFile.mjs** – Write content to a file in the ioBroker file system.
- **fileExists.mjs** – Check if a file exists in the ioBroker file system.
- **mkdir.mjs** – Create a new directory in the ioBroker file system.
- **renameFile.mjs** – Rename a file or directory in the ioBroker file system.
- **deleteFile.mjs** – Delete a file in the ioBroker file system.

## Basic Authentication

get a base64 encoded string gof your username and password

```
console.log(Buffer.from("username:password").toString("base64"))
```

```
{
	"servers": {
		"iobroker-remote": {
			"type": "http",
			"url": "http://localhost:8082/kiwi/0/mcp",
			"headers": {
				"cache-control": "no-cache",
				"authorization": "Basic YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_STRING_HERER"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## Changelog
